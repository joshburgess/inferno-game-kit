![alt text](inferno-game-kit.png "Game Development with Inferno")

This is just a fork of [react-game-kit](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-game-kit) where React has been aliased as [Inferno](https://github.com/trueadm/inferno).  

Simply by swapping out React for Inferno, the following was achieved:
* 255kb â†’ 65kb
* -40% CPU time
* -25% memory

Instructions:

```
git clone https://github.com/joshburgess/inferno-game-kit
cd inferno-game-kit
npm i
npm start
```
Then, open localhost:3000 in your browser.
